This whole project is developed through |Zhuhong|webchat:lemon1900_78|0086-15805169356| 

This project is supported by six modules including room2function-zone module, tatami-layout module, furniture-DNA-module, tatami-furniture-recom-module, tatami-furniture-refine-module,tatami-accessory module.

1.room2function-zone module works to predict the rough layout of function-zones for an empty room.

2.tatami-layout-type module works to auto-choose the suitable type of furniture layout for an empty room.

3.tatami-funiture-DNA layout module works to predict the furniture layout using the choosen DNA.

4.tatami-furniture-recom-search-module works to recommend the furniture in the supply chain if the DNA is not appliable to the empty room.

6.tatami-furniture-accessory-design-module works to both prdict the layout of the accessories and recommend the suitabole accessories for the furniture.

For all of the six moduels, we develop deep CNN models, small on-line database, deep recommendation system, deep-refine models to work together for the tatami-layout task. 
We also compare our layout results with the results of Kujiale.

In Aijia-Deep-Custom-Layout-Team, for custom-size furniture layout of tatami, we work about one year from zero to on-line service for the custom furniture layout in the interior design industry.
